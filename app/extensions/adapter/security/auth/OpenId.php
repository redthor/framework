/**
 * The `Auth` adapter provides basic authentication facilities for checking credentials submitted
 * via a web form against an LDAP server. To perform an authentication check, the adapter accepts
 * an instance of a `Request` object which contains the submitted form data in its `$data` property.
 *
 * When a request is submitted, the adapter will take the form data from the `Request` object,
 * apply any filters as appropriate (see the `'filters'` configuration setting below), and
 * attempt to connect to an LDAP server using using the filtered data.
 *
 * If successfully connected, it will retrieve the user's account record and return it to be
 * store in the session data.
 *
 * By default it's set to look for an LDAP server locally. You will probably need to in the least, adjust the basedn.
 * You must always pass a "password" field in your request data. It will not be used to assemble the login RDN.
 * You will pass in the `'fields'` key any field from the login form (request data) that need to be assembled into
 * the login RDN. You can optionally pass additional parameters to be assembled in the RDN with the `'targetdn'` key.
 * 
 * An example configuration might look like the following:
 * {{{
 *      Auth::config(array(
 *              'customer' => array(
 *                      'adapter' => 'Ldap',
 *                      'fields' => array('uid'),
 *                      'server' => array(
 *                          'host' => 'ldapserver.com',
 *                          'basedn' => 'o=ldapserver.com',
 *                          'targetdn' => 'ou=People'
 *                      )
 *              )
 *      ));
 * }}}
 *
 * Another example, if the "ou" field needed to be passed in the request data and be able to be changed on the form
 * for some reason or another:
 * {{{
 *      Auth::config(array(
 *              'customer' => array(
 *                      'adapter' => 'Ldap',
 *                      'fields' => array('uid', 'ou'),
 *                      'server' => array(
 *                          'host' => 'ldapserver.com',
 *                          'basedn' => 'o=ldapserver.com'
 *                      )
 *              )
 *      ));
 * }}}
 *
 * To have the "ou" property be set to "People" you would maybe have a drop down with a name of "ou" on your login form.
 * This might switch out the "ou" value for some reason. Perhaps you're selecting a "group" when logging in, etc.
 *
 * An example RDN that might be constructed would look like:
 * uid=Myuser, ou=Person, o=ldapserver.com
 *
 * Then, again, the "password" field would be used with this RDN to login to the LDAP server.
 *
 * As mentioned, prior to any queries being executed, the request data is modified by any filters
 * configured. Filters are callbacks which accept the value of a field as input, and return a
 * modified version of the value as output. Filters can be any PHP callable, i.e. a closure or
 * `array('ClassName', 'method')`. The Ldap auth adapter will filter the password field by default in order
 * to hash it by `lithium\util\String::hash()`. You may or may not need to hash the password before sending to the
 * LDAP server. Typically you won't be with an LDAP server, but any other fields you may need to alter for any reason,
 * you can do so using callbacks that you define.
 *
 * Note that if you are specifying the `'fields'` configuration using key/value pairs, the key
 * used to specify the filter must match the key side of the `'fields'` assignment.
